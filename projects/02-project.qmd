# **Project Overview**  
This project explores how **societal and political factors** influence **WNBA attendance and TV viewership**. By analyzing trends over multiple seasons, we examined how key performance metrics—such as **win-loss records, points per game, and team success**—correlate with audience engagement.  

Despite the league's growing popularity, **viewership and attendance trends** are influenced by external factors like **media coverage, player advocacy, and public perception**. Through this project, we aimed to quantify these influences and provide data-driven insights into the league’s growth.  

# **Data Collection & Analysis**  
- **Data Source:** WNBA Website  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Processed in Excel  
- **Visualization & Analysis:** Conducted in Tableau  
- **Presentation:** Published on WordPress  

We began by collecting historical WNBA data, including **team performance, win-loss records, points per game, and other statistics**. After **cleaning and organizing** the data in **Excel**, we imported it into **Tableau**, where we created various **bar charts, line charts, and maps** to visually represent trends in viewership and attendance.  

By integrating **statistical analysis with interactive visuals**, we uncovered significant patterns that shed light on how the WNBA’s reception has evolved over time.
